Mod contains a playable race, a playable ship (3 types) with custom equipment, a themed sector type with new events and new enemy ships. Everything in the mod is added to the game without replacing anything.


Orchids are floral lifeforms who evolved to be able to move, fight in close combat, and travel through space in ships made of giant seeds. Their name was given by humans for resembling Earth plants, but they have little in common.

Fragile and vulnerable, especially to fire, Orchids would not be able to survive in space without cunning and manipulation. Being able to produce oxygen, Orchids are seen as viable allies, and often form symbiotic relationships with other races. Even though Orchids seem harmless at first glance, they hide lethal weapons behind innocent facade and are as deadly in close combat as other species.

Orchids are unable of articulate speech, so they have to resort to communicating using chemical signals. With relatively short lifespans, Orchids quickly evolved to affect specific races using different aromas, especially weak-minded races, like humans, or Mantis. On larger distances, Orchids communicate using written language that they borrowed from other aliens.

Orchid abilities:
* Provide oxygen to rooms they are in
* Take 4x damage from fire
* Put out fires at half speed
